<h2>About</h2>


<p> Thank you for stopping by.

I is my hope that in the next little while you will be curious, and hopefully even inspired by some new thought, personal goals, and the underlying design goals we all share that go beyond simply displaying information. 

My goal is to really understand people. I wish to understand their personality, their values, their emotions, and goals. Itâ€™s important for me to understand what those traits mean when a person promotes a message from themselves to the public.

I believe that great design happens when the design communicates the traits of the promoters, the designers, and the traits of the public viewing it. When the larger population agrees, respects, and engages in the positive values promoted through a message my personal goal is complete.

My humble role in the whole design process is to communicate the concepts and takeaways one person wants to share with the other. One profession that does this is Graphic Design that I am a part of. </p>
